This is the final project in the Computer Graphics course, a park.

A few things to note:
This was written on a RedHat Linux 9 distribution
The makefile was not written by me, but did work using RedHat and Suze Linux.  I make no guarentees that it will work.
There is some animation in the park (swinging swings), but it was written on older hardware and does not take processor speed into consideration.  I have no idea how fast the swings will swing using modern hardware.
No special graphical tricks used.  Just dull colors.  There isn't even any hit detection outside of outer boundaries.
